# `README.md` for [tts-ds-ai](https://github.com/Ai-Yukino/tts-ds-ai)

---

Additional class materials I created to update the data science curriculum for TTS ([website](https://www.techtalentsouth.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-talent-south/))

Also see my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWeXKKarcHoy5c1LvjSQMg) for example homework/lab solutions

## ‚ùÑ Contents

### `/hello`

Various "Hello World!" software installation labs for installing and using software

The order to do these labs is

- `windows-terminal.md` (if you use Windows)
- `WSL.md` (if you use Windows)
- `conda.md`
- `git.md`
- `ssh-github.md`

This software suite was inspired by TTS's data science curriculum as well as [goodresearch.dev](https://goodresearch.dev/setup.html)'s modern data science workflow for python[^1].
