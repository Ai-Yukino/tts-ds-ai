## üå∏ Submission

A `.yml` config file of your conda environment with the latest version of python

## ‚ùÑ Tips

- Run `conda create --name tts-ds` to create an empty conda virtual environment named "tts-ds". You can replace "tts-ds" with whatever name you prefer.
- Run `conda activate base` to activate the `base` environment. You can replace `base` to be the name of whatever environment you want to activate as long as you have created it in your local machine.
- Run `conda search python` to see all the available versions of python you can install
- Run `conda install python=3.10.2` to install python version "3.10.2".
- Run `conda env export --from-history > env.yml` to export a config file named `env.yml`.
