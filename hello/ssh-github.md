5) Generate a SSH key and add it to your ssh-agent following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    - Windows users should follow the linux instructions in their WSL terminal
    - Everyone can skip the "Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key" section

## üå∏ FAQ

### What if I see an error message like this when trying to clone a repo after following all these steps?

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.112.4)' can't be established.  
> ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:p2QAMXNIC1TJYWeIOttrVc98/R1BUFWu3/LiyKgUfQM.  
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  

---

Double-check if the key fingerprint matches GitHub's key fingerprints [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints). If so, then type "yes" and git should finishing cloning the repo for you with some message like this:

> Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.112.4' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

Your repo should still be cloned successfully though.

### Why does git ask me for my username after I initialize a new repository?

Because we are using ssh as our credentials, you should also try to use "ssh syntax" whenever possible. For example, you should run

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name
```

instead of

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name
```

Also don't forgot to do step (9) in the instructions so that git knows where to find your private ssh key!
