1) Create a GitHub account and log in
    - You can use an existing GitHub account if you want
3) Set up a commit email on GitHub following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github).
    - If you choose to make your email private in step (5) above, then your commit email will be the `...@users.noreply.github.com`
4) Save your commit email in a `.txt` file for later
---
4) Generate a SSH key and add it to your ssh-agent following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    - Windows users should follow the linux instructions in their WSL terminal
    - Everyone can skip the "Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key" section
---

6) Open your terminal

    - Do not put quotes around your email in the above command!
9) Run `git config --global core.sshCommand = ssh -i path-to-your-private-ssh-key` where `path-to-your-private-ssh-key` might look something like `~/.ssh/id_25519` if you accepted the default name in step (4).

## üå∏ FAQ

**Question**: What if I see an error message like this when trying to clone a repo after following all these steps?

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.112.4)' can't be established.  
> ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:p2QAMXNIC1TJYWeIOttrVc98/R1BUFWu3/LiyKgUfQM.  
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  

**Answer**: Double-check if the key fingerprint matches GitHub's key fingerprints [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints). If so, then type "yes" and git should finishing cloning the repo for you with some message like this:

> Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.112.4' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

Your repo should still be cloned successfully though.
