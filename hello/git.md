[^1]: **Note**: If you are a Windows user and installed WSL (with Ubuntu), then you should be able to use
git in the WSL terminal. However, if you plan to also use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows, 
then you may need to also directly install Git directly on Windows to enable Git integration with VS Code, 
i.e. when VS Code tells you which files have not been comitted yet.
